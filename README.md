VACCINE MONITORING USING LOCALIZED BACKEND  COMMUNICATION WITH REST AND SELF -HOSTED API

In real-world application, projects using public and open-source API will not suffice 
the needs of a private organization and its security is questionable. To overcome this, 
creating a local hosted API to Store data is more secure as it is not connected to the 
internet. Also gives us flexibility and reliability compared to an open-source 
environment.
